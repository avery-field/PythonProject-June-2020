[Starts with SNL monologue intro.] [band is playing music one the stage]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Chris.

[Chris walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
Chris: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is incredible. The last time I was on live TV was when I did Australia's version of "Dancing With The Stars." Yep, that's true. Um, but most likely, tonight will be even more embarrassing than that. Probably my biggest role that I've been implying and you would know me from is Thor. [cheers and applause] I've played Thor in four different movies. Thor 1, Thor 2, The Avengers and Gone Girl.
Now, I'm not the only actor in my family. I have brothers. Two of them. Three of them, maybe. Four, I don't know. But they're actors as well. So, if it was okay, I thought I would bring them out and share this moment.
[Liam and Luke Hemsworth walk in] [cheers and applause]
I'm sorry. Almost forgot. I have a brother, Callum.
[Callum walks in]
Callum: Alright. Good day.
[cheers and applause]
Chris: Look at this. It's the four Hemsworth brothers.
Callum: [speaking in fake Australian accent] Yeah, lot of cake up here, ladies!

Liam: Yeah, Callum's actually an actor as well.
Callum: [speaking in fake Australian accent] Yeah, that's right. I do series of instructional videos. About dinner with snakes in the workplace.
Luke: Why don't you tell them about your big catch phrase?
[Cut to Chris and Callum]
Callum: [speaking in fake Australian accent] Oh, yeah, yeah! It's just one line where I go. "Kill it!"
[Cut to everybody]
Chris: Well, here you have. You have Hemsworth boys. Anyone have any questions for us?
[Cut to Cecily]
Cecily: Um, I do. What's it like to be called world's sexiest man?

[Cut to the Hemsworth brothers]
Chris: Well-
Callum: [interrupting] Well, I'll tell you this one here buddies. [speaking in fake Australian accent] It's just a bit weird coz I just think of myself as a normal guy. But, um, then I see myself in a mirror and I can't argue with it.
Chris: Yeah, I wanna say this. It doesn't matter what you look like. What really matters is what's in here. Muscles! [looking at the audience] Yes, you sir.
[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: This is a question for Callum. I noticed your accent is slightly different from the other guys. Are you sure you're from Australia?
[Cut to Chris and Callum]
Callum: [speaking in fake Australian accent] Me? Australia? [Callum starts mumbling stuffs]
Chris: Alright, you know what? Believe it or not, believe it or not, Callum, he's actually adopted. He's from a place in northern territory which is called Atlanta.

Callum: Yeah, it's way out in the whoop-whoop.
Chris: Um-hmm. [looking at the audience] Next question.
[Cut to Bobby]
Bobby: Hi. You all seem so genuine. How do you stay so down to earth?
[Cut to the Hemsworth brothers]
Liam: It's because of our mum.
Luke: She raised us really, really well.

Chris: She did, she did. We might bring her out actually. Come on our, mum.
Callum: There she is.
[Mum walks in clapping]
Mum: Alright, alright. There's my boys. Some folks have one son. I have a leader.
Chris: Yeah! We just wanted to say thank you mum, for everything.
Mum: Well, you've always ruined my body, so it's least you can do. Ha-ha.

Chris: We've got a great show for you tonight. Zac Brown band is here.
[cheers and applause]
Stick around, and we'll be right back.
