Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Jonah Hill.
[Jonah Hill walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
Jonah Hill: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. I've had such a crazy year. Wow. So much happened. I had a starring role in the 'Hail, Caesar!'? trailer. What else? I saw Deadpool opening day. Oh, thank god! A question.
[Cut to Kyle in the audience]
Kyle: Hey, Jonah. Medium fan here. I notice you haven't starred in a movie in a long time.
[Cut to Jonah Hill]
Jonah Hill: Well, first of all, crazy roots. Second of all, that's not really a question, Kyle.
[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: Okay, here's a question. What's it like being a movie star? I mean, can you ask one of your friends?

[Cut to Jonah Hill]
Jonah Hill: Ah! It's really funny, Kyle. I love you videos that you make. They remind me of how much I miss Andy Samberg.
[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: [yelling] Yeah, I miss your career!
[Cut to Jonah Hill]
Jonah Hill: I hate you so much, Kyle. Anyway, this is my fourth time hosting. So-[cheers and applause] Crazy. So, I thought I'd mix it up and we have an amazing musical guest tonight. Future! I'm such a big fan of Future. I figure I'm such a big fan of Future, let's forget the monologue and just kick things off with a musical performance by Future featuring Drake.
[Future walks in]
Future: Drake is not here, man!
Jonah Hill: Oh, he's not? I guess I could do it.
[Jay walks in]
Jay: Oh, no, no. I'll do it. I'll do it.

Jonah Hill: Get out of here. Get out of here, Jay. Nobody wants to see that. Anyway, Futs, you were insisting I should do Drake's part?
Future: I never days that.
Jonah Hill: I guess I do know it. But? we're gonna do this little rap. I just have one question.
Future: No, you can't say any of the 'N' words.
Jonah Hill: No, of course not. I wouldn't dream of them. I never sing them.
Future: Even when you're alone.

Jonah Hill: Let's do this. Jump man.
