Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Cameron Diaz.
[cheers and applause] [Cameron Diaz walks in and to the stage]
Cameron Diaz: Thank you. Thank you, thank you very much. My name is Cameron Diaz and I am so happy to be here hosting the thanksgiving show. [cheers and applause] It's so exciting to be in Rockefeller center when they light up the big turkey. I've been so busy lately. I have a movie coming out. So, I've been doing so many interviews and press events. It's just so nice to be here at SNL just having fun and not having to answer so many questions-

Brad Parsin: Excuse me. Excuse me. [Cut to Brad Parsin in the audience] I have a question. Brad Parsin, film student, new school. I just wanna say I thought gangs of New York was ground breaking both in style and subject matter. I guess my question is, I think you're hot.
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: That's not a question. And if you're gonna ask questions, let's just make them easy, okay guys?
Venessa: Oh, oh! I've got one. [Cut to Venessa in the audience] Was working in The Other Woman like so much fun?
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: It was.
[Cut to Venessa]
Venessa: Thank you. I knew it.
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: Okay, great. Well, if that's all the interruptions then-

[Bobby Moynihan walks in]
Bobby Moynihan: Hey, Cameron.
Cameron Diaz: Oh, hey Bobby.
Bobby Moynihan: Hey. It was so much fun doing Annie with you.
Cameron Diaz: Bobby, were you in Annie?
Bobby Moynihan: Yeah! I had one line. Does this ring a bell? "If this guy keeps singing and dancing like this, he's never gonna get elected." Thank you.
Cameron Diaz: Is that line in the movie?

Bobby Moynihan: I don't know. They did not invite me to the premiere.
[Bobby Moynihan turns around and leaves]
Cameron Diaz: Yes, you.
[Cut to Leslie in the audience]
Leslie: Um, is Shrek just as grumpy in real life?
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: Hmm, well, I mean, Shrek is cartoon.
[cut to Leslie being confused.]
Leslie: Uh-huh.

[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: Yes, he is always in a bad mood. You know, he's an ogre.
[Cut to Leslie]
Leslie: I knew it.
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: Okay, one last question. Anybody?
[Cut to Beck in the audience]
Beck: Hi, Cameron. Are you familiar with the concept of celebrity sex exception? Because if you're interested, my wife has already given us to go ahead.
[Aidy stands up]
Aidy: Yeah, mine was Tony Danza and let's just say, box checked.

Beck: Well, that's not important.
Aidy: Who's the boss? He's the boss.
[Cut to Cameron Diaz]
Cameron Diaz: Okay. Well, we've got a great show tonight. Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson are here. So, stick around and we'll be right back.
[cheers and applause]
