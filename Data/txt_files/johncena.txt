Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, John Cena.
[John Cena walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
John Cena: Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you very much. My name if John Cena and to those of you who voted for Hillary, I'm a wrestler. [crowd laughs late] Yeah, well, late bloomers but that's okay. Normally on TV, you see me in the ring throwing down all the other WWE superstars, and I love it. But it's exciting to get away for a week and do something a little different. And now, I'm gonna need someone to help me sing. Get out here, New York Santa!
[Bobby Moynihan in Santa outfit walks in]
Bobby Moynihan: Ho, ho, ho. I'm locking it.
John Cena: The normal Santa travels by a sleigh. [Bobby Moynihan starts opening his Santa costume] But the New York-
Bobby Moynihan: [interrupting] No! Cena! You think you can do comedy and wrestling? Well, two can play that game. Get ready to feel the pain of? The Waddler.

Bobby Moynihan: I waddled! [running towards the stage] Oh! I'm coming for you, Cena.
John Cena: Okay, well you do.
Bobby Moynihan: Oh, I just move real weird. [moving around John Cena's behind] What are you gonna do when The Waddler's coming for you, Cena? Hun?
John Cena: [laughing] I mean, that's actually really cool. Did you make that outfit?

Bobby Moynihan: I did.
John Cena: That's- I actually think you could be a great WWE superstar.
Bobby Moynihan: Oh my god, wow. Um, thank you, John. You did not have to say that.
John Cena: Bring it in here, man!
Bobby Moynihan: Okay.
