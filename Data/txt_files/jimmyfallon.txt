Jimmy Fallon
[Starts with SNL monologue intro] [Cut to SNL stage] [Band is playing music]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Jimmy Fallon.
[Jimmy Fallon walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
Jimmy Fallon: Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. It is so great. I love you. I love you. It's so great to be back here on 'Saturday Night Live.' This is where it all started for me. And I'm so happy to come home. Tonight is extra special because this is the first time in SNL history that we are going out live coast to coast all across the country and Canada. Tonight is bigger than a show. It's a party.
[band playing music]
Hello, Chicago. Hello, San Fransisco. We're out here at New York city.
Hello Montreal. Hello Houston, Colorado, New Hampshire.

Brooklyn!
[Jimmy Fallon calls the audience, and they stand and dance with him too] [singing] Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
on song they're playing on the radio

[Harry Styles joins]
Let's Sway
from the lights of you face
Let's Sway
sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide

Because my love for you
would break my heart in two
if you should fall into my arms
and tremble like a flower 
[guitar solo]
Let's dance
put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's sway
under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
would break my heart in two
if you should fall into my arms
and tremble like a flower
[music stops]
We have got a great show tonight! Harry Styles is here! Stick around and we'll be right back!
