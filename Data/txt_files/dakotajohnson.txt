New York is so beautiful this time of year. Just kidding. For those of you who don't know me, I am currently starring in Fifty Shades of Grey. Fifty Shades of Grey is based on the best selling novel that that made you wanna never touch your mother's kindle again. Doing this movie has completely changed my life. Like, for instance, my dry cleaner won't look me in the eyes anymore. And my dog walker gives me a little wink every time he takes a lease off the wall. It's so great.
But this movie is a ton of fun and I'm really proud of it. And I don't want to speak too soon but I have a funny feeling that at next year's Oscars, it's gonna be not anywhere. But who cares? Right? I mean, I don't care about that. But, it's already made like, $500 million and the fans really love it. And by fans, I mean very specific group of-

[Cut to Kyle in the audience.He is wearing kinky leather outfit.]
Kyle: Hey, hello. Hi, excuse me. Hi. I was wondering if I could ask you a question.
[Cut to Dakota Johnson]
Dakota Johnson: Oh, we're not really doing questions, sir.
[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: What if I begged?
[Cut to Dakota Johnson]
Dakota Johnson: Okay, alright. Quickly, what is it?
[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: I was just wondering, who do you think will be the GOP front runner for 2016?
[Cut to Dakota Johnson]
Dakota Johnson: Oh, really? That's not what I was expecting you to ask.

[Cut to Kyle]
Kyle: I'm just kidding. I wanted to ask if you'd sign my wife's ball gag. Honey?
[Kate stands up from the audience. She has the ball gag in her mouth, and now she puts it out.]
Kate: Your movie has brought us a lot closer. Even the kids have noticed.
[Cut to Dakota Johnson]
Dakota Johnson: That is so sweet. Great, okay. And now I understand why my parents will not be seeing my movie. You may not know this, but my parents are Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. [cheers and applause] And it's actually really incredible that I am standing on this stage right now because in December of 1988, my mother stood in this exact spot and hosted SNL. [cheers and applause] And this is true. This is true. Right after the show, my father got down on one knee and he proposed to her for the second time. And exactly nine months later, I was born. [Someone in the audience claps once] So, I must have- Thanks for that. One clap. So, I must have been conceived that night after the show? or maybe even during the show. Isn't that right, you guys?
[Cut to Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith in the audience covering their faces trying to hide.] [cheers and applause] [Cut to Dakota Johnson]
What's wrong? Are you embarrassed that I told that story?
[Cut to Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith]
Don Johnson: No, no. We were just afraid you were gonna be naked.
[Cut to Dakota Johnson]
Dakota Johnson: We have got a great show for you tonight. Alabama Shakes are here. Stick around, we'll be right back.
