[Starts with SNL monologue intro]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, James Franco
[cheers and applause] [James Franco walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
James Franco: Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm James Franco. Actor, poet, artist, dude. So, something pretty crazy happened this week. I have this movie called 'Interview' coming out with Seth Rogan at Sony, and this week Sony Studios got all their computers hacked. This is true. These hackers have leaked real personal information about everybody that works with Sony. Social security numbers, emails, and I know eventually they're gonna start leaking out stuff about me. So, before you hear it somewhere else, I thought it'd be better for you to hear it from me. Soon you'll know that my email is cuterthandavefranco@aol.com. My password is littlejameseycutiepie. And this is all just a real violation of my personal life.
Seth Rogan: Yo, James!
[Seth Rogan walks n] [cheers and applause]
James Franco: Seth?
Seth Rogan: Yes. It's actually much worse than we thought it was gonna be, man!
James Franco: What?
Seth Rogan: You're not gonna believe this. But, an hour ago, they released some of our private photos from our phones.

James Franco: What? Oh, my god! What, which photos?
Seth Rogan: All of them.
James Franco: You mean, the one I took of you in your dressing room?
Seth Rogan: Yeah, yeah, yeah! With the control top pantyhose.

I was trying to look a little slimmer.
James Franco: I thought you looked great.

Seth Rogan: Thank you. Thank you, but they also leaked this one of me teaching you how to read.

James Franco: Oh, no!
Seth Rogan: You were making such good progress, man! Look, they also put out that one where we tried to be John and Yoko.
[Cut to a picture of Seth Rogan and James Franco cuddling.] [Cut to James Franco and Seth Rogan]
James Franco: I actually like that one.
Seth Rogan: Well, you are not gonna like this. It's that picture I took of you while you were sleeping.
[Cut to a picture of James Franco sleeping on a toilet commode while he's pooping.] [Cut to James Franco and Seth Rogan]
James Franco: What? Why would you take that?

Seth Rogan: I don't know, man! Worst of all, they leaked our Christmas card.
[Cut to a picture of James Franco and Seth Rogan with Santa Claus. They are naked and are covering their personal parts with red socks.] [Cut to James Franco and Seth Rogan]
James Franco: Well, I mean we should still send that out, right?
Seth Rogan: Absolutely.
James Franco: Okay. Alright.
[Seth Rogan leaves]
We've got a great- Oh! Oh! Oh! Also, all the girls who got any Instagram messages from me this year, last year, the hackers did it. It was that hacker!

Alright, we got a great show for you. Nicki Minaj is here. Stick around, we'll be right back.
