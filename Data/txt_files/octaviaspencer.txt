Octavia Spencer: Thank you. Thank you. It's so great to be hosting 'Saturday Night Live'! It's a dream come true to be here. No, really. I have spent the last four months of my life at award shows doing interviews and walking red carpets, so this is my first real night out of my spanx. Just kidding, I'm still wearing spanx. And by the way, did you all watch the Oscars? [cheers and applause] I mean, how insane was that? How crazy was it that I didn't win? Oh, look, but I mean it when I say it, it truly is an honor to be nominated because - for a good part of my career, I pretty much just played nurses. I played a nurse 16 times. I did it so many times that when I played a maid, they gave me an Oscar. I guess I have what Hollywood calls 'resting nurse face'. For example, I played nurse that had it. [Grounded for life] A nurse that had it up to here. [Red band society] And a nurse that had it so bad, this happened. [Halloween II] Yeah, she got stabbed bad. So, after all that, it was so wonderful to play a NASA mathematician like I do in 'Hidden Figures'. People have been so kin to me about that movie. So many people have been coming up to me saying, "I love Hidden Fences." And I say, "No, I was in Hidden Figures." I mean, I get it, I get it. There were three black movies at the Oscars this year, and that's a lot for America. If you were going to get confused anyway, I thought I might as well make some money off of it. That's why, I produced 'Hidden Fence Light.' It's the story of three black women who send an introspective gay boy to build a fence on the moon.
Oh, we've got a great show for you tonight. Father John Misty is here. So, stick around and we'll be right back.
