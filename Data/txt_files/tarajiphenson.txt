Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Taraji P. Henson.
[Taraji P. Henson walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
Taraji P. Henson: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is so nice! Oh my god, being in Saturday Night Live really means so much to me because it proves that after 20 years of show business, white people finally know who I am.
[cheers and applause]
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Look, now I've been around a while, but a lot of you are just getting to know me as Cookie on Empire.
[cheers and applause]
Thank you. No, no, no, real talk. This role changed my life. I mean, I spent so many years hustling in this business and now I'm here. So, I guess you can say I made it. Hallelujah!
[Taraji P. Henson gets a mic] [music playing] [singing] Don't worry about where you are
be grateful that you've come this far
you may not always come in first
just remember, that it could be worse
I could have been in acts to older Lion King
could be wearing some giant two wings
could be tryina' make some bachelor holla!
could be twerking on a pole for a dollar
I could have been a hiphop, being a hoe
didn't work no twice, but let no more

[backup singers come behind her.]
I know all that stuff matters now
coz I made it.
Backup singers: Oh, yes, you made it.
Taraji P. Henson: I used to tip 5, now it's 30%

Backup singers: Oh, yes, you made it.
Taraji P. Henson: Oh, yes! I made it.
All my stuffs at apartment just to pay rent
Backup singers: Oh, yes, you made it.
Taraji P. Henson: Oh, yes I made it
Kudo pasta samples in the grocery store
although they know that I couldn't pay no more
Backup singers: I know all that stuff matters now
coz you made it.
Taraji P. Henson: Oh, yes, I made it.

Now listen. Instead of worrying about where we want to be, how about we try to be thankful for where we're not? Tthink about all the things we could be doing right now. We're blessed. Somebody better testify.
