[Starts with SNL monologue intro.] [band is playing music one the stage]
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Elizabeth Banks.
[Elizabeth Banks walks in and to the stage] [cheers and applause]
Elizabeth Banks: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope I look okay. I just came from the gym. You may know me from the Hunger Games movies where I play Effie Trinket. I think we have a couple of Trinket heads in the audience tonight.
[Cut to Kyle Mooney wearing wig and make-up as Effie Trinket in the audience]
Kyle: [Screaming] Yes!
[Cut to Elizabeth Banks]
Elizabeth Banks: Now, most of you probably know me as an actress but I also recently caught the directing bug. That's right. I directed Pitch Perfect 2. And I honestly don't know what I like more. Being in front of the camera or behind it because I really see things as a director now. Like, I'm noticing that this shot is just a scooch tight. You're kind of losing the dress. Let me ask our director. Hey Don.
Don: Yes, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth Banks: Do me a favor. Pop out a smidge.
Don: You got it.
[The camera zooms out a little bit. You can see Elizabeth Banks's dress better now.]
Elizabeth Banks: Perfect! Great! I might give a few more notes as we go.

Don: Please don't.
Elizabeth Banks: Oh, no. That's right. It's your show. It's just? ah! I'm so unbelievably excited to be up here right now. So, I'm gonna take this one. Cue music.
[music playing]
Lights to half.
[Lights dim a little]
Yeah, that's nice. Microphone.
[Someone hands over a micto Elizabeth Banks]
And cue talent.

but a slow blowing dream


B camera.

That your fears seem to high
deep inside your mind
Give me a close up.

All alone I have cried
Too close!
[Close up shot slowly zooms out]
silent tears for the price

Better.
In a world made of steel
made of stone
Let's loose this dress and get funky!
[two helpers come in and start opening Elizabeth Banks's dress.]
Well I feel the music
Cue, snow.

[artificial snow stars pouring on the stage]
close my eyes, feel the rhythm
Go stars!
[a sparkling star appears on the screen]
Round, take a whole of my heart
Up to the sky cam.

Green screen.

[Elizabeth Banks runs to the middle of the stage]
I can have it all now

Take your passion
Not Bobby. Lose Bobby.
