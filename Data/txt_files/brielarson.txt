Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, Brie Larson.
[Brie Larson walks in and to the stage]

[cheers and applause]
Brie Larson: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Hey everybody, it is so wonderful to be here. As I hope you all know tomorrow is Mother's Day. So it's fitting that I'm hosting tonight because I played a very strong mother in a movie every kid should watch with their mom on Mother's Day called 'Room'. Don't do that. The movie is pretty intense. 10 minutes, and my own mom went to go get popcorn and just never came back. Speaking of my mom, she's here tonight. [Cut to Brie's mom in the audience] Happy Mother's Day, mom. Are you excited for the show?
Brie's Mom: Yeah, I love Alicia Keys.
[Cut to Brie Larson]
Brie Larson: Okay, cool.
[Beck walks in]

Beck: Hey Brie, sorry to interrupt. I forgot it was Mother's Day tomorrow. Do you mind if I do special message for my mom?
Brie Larson: Oh, yeah. Of course Beck, yes.
Beck: Thanks. [looking at the camera and putting his arm around Brie's shoulder] Hey mom, so this is the girl I've been telling you about. See? I told you she's real. And a girl.
Brie Larson: [removing Beck's hand from her shoulder] Maybe not that.
Beck: Oh right, sure. And, um, happy Mother's Day. I love you.
Brie Larson: We're not dating Beck.

Beck: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Good looks and a sense of humor. You look out there babe, I'll be waiting in the dressing room. [whispering] Ask here where, oh!
[Beck leaves]
Brie Larson: For the record, miss Bennett, I am not dating your son. But since it's Mother's Day, if anyone else has a message for their mom, come on up.
[Bobby walks in]
Bobby: Oh, I do Brie. Is that okay?

Brie Larson: Sure. Go ahead, Bobby.
Bobby: Hey mom, do me a favor. Get the remote, go in my room and record all seasons of Vanderpump Rules. Thanks mom. Happy Mother's Day. I love you.
Brie Larson: You live with your mom?
Bobby: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I pay rent.
[Bobby walks out and Pete walks in]

Pete: Hey Brie, um, my mom's watching tonight. So do you mind if I said something?
Brie Larson: Um, Pete, we're kind of running low on time now.
[Pete's mom walks in]
Pete: Oh, okay. Okay mom, Brie Larson said she doesn't have time for you.
Brie Larson: Oh-okay. Okay, Pete. I didn't know that your mom was right there. Of course, hi, happy Mother's Day. Say something.

Pete: Oh. Happy Mother's Day, mom. I love you.
Brie Larson: It's so sweet that you brought you mom tonight.
Pete: She comes, um, every show.
[Pete and his mom walks out]
[Kate walks in]
Kate: Hey Brie, can I bring my mom up here?
Brie Larson: Of course.
Kate: Come on, ma.
[Kate's mom walks in]
Kate: Brie, loved you in the movie 'Short Term 12. She just wanted to meet you.
Kate's mom: Well, who doesn't like a good Brie?
Kate: She wrote that.
Brie Larson: Ha-ha, yeah. [Kate and her mom leave] Oh, it's my turn. Mom, can you please come up here?
[Brie's mom walks in]
You've been so supportive to me over the years. Endless words of encouragement. And as a token of my appreciation, I got you a front row seat to the hottest show in New York.
Brie's mom: Hamilton?
Brie Larson: No mom, no. This show. And we've got a great one. Alicia Keys is here. So stick around. We will be right back.
